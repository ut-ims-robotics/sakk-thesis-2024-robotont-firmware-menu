# Development of a user interface for the open robotics platform Robotont 3

## Thesis overview

A workgroup in the Institute of Technology of the University of Tartu is developing an educational robotics platform named Robotont. Recently, the development of the third generation of Robotont has begun, which includes a redesign of the electronics. The control board now supports a screen module and an encoder knob. The goal of this thesis was to implement firmware for a user interface designed for the added devices. A study of user interfaces of various types of electronics was conducted and the best practices learned were kept in mind during the design process. The new user interface has expanded Robotontâ€™s functionality and allows for integration with the Robot Operating System framework running on the onboard computer.
